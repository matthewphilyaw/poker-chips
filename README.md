[buyin] [denom:denom:denom:denom...] [number of highest denom desired] [step between denoms in count]

example

10.00 1:5:10:20:50 10 5

this will mean you want ten 50 denom chips and that you increase the count 
of each denom by 5 as you step down to the lowest denom

denom   count
50      10
20      15
10      20
5       25
1       30

it will show the value beside it as well
